# Dynamic Agent-Based Modeling and Analysis of Epidemic Spread as a Complex Adaptive System

This project explores epidemic spread as a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) through a dynamic agent-based simulation. Using the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model as a foundation, the simulation extends it with additional states such as Vaccinated and Vaccinator agents, while also incorporating heterogeneous properties like age, health status, and immunity levels.

The simulation is implemented in Python with Pygame, enabling real-time visualization of how individual agent interactions lead to emergent, population-level behaviors. By experimenting with varying conditions—such as disease virulence, vaccination interventions, quarantine strategies, and agent movement patterns (including flocking via the Boids algorithm)—the model highlights the adaptive dynamics between disease spread and population responses.
